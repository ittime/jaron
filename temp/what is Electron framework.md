* Electron is an open-source framework developed by GitHub that allows developers to create cross-platform desktop applications using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime, providing a way to build desktop applications with web technologies commonly used in web development.
* With Electron, developers can leverage their existing web development skills to build desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux, reaching a broader audience with a single codebase. Electron applications have access to native operating system APIs through Node.js modules, enabling them to interact with the underlying system and provide a native-like user experience. This makes Electron a popular choice for building desktop applications, particularly for web developers looking to expand their development capabilities to desktop platforms.
